<h3>
HOW TO MAKE THE BLACKBOARD CLOCK.<br>
</h3>
</div>

<p>Draw a circle, about a foot in diameter,
on the blackboard, in a convenient
place where it may remain.
Place a dot in the center. Inside
the circle place the figures, hour and
minute marks as you have them on
the face of your watch or clock.</p>

<p>If the clock is to be made on a
wooden blackboard it will be best to
have slips cut from tin for the hour
and minute hands, and fastened to
the center of the face with a slender
screw; but if the board is of hard
finish, and a screw of any kind will
not answer, the next best plan will
be to cut the hands from hard, white
pasteboard and fasten them in place
by means of a long pin, using a hard
piece of pasteboard, cut round, for a
washer.</p>

<p>Exercise care to have the minute
hand long enough to reach exactly to
the minute spaces, and the hour
hand to the hour figures only.</p>

<p>The clock is thus made ready for
use, though it will be made more attractive
by drawing lines representing
a case about the face in colored crayon.
A smooth board having the
dimensions of twelve by twenty
inches, or thereabout, may be painted
and prepared to represent a clock.</p>

<p>An old clock with a worn out
movement answers still better for the
purpose than the blackboard clock.</p>

<h3>
TEACH THE PUPILS HOW TO TELL THE TIME.<br>
</h3>
</div>


<p>First,—Teach the pupils to count
to sixty.</p>

<p>Develop the idea of, and teach the
pupils to write the Roman and Arabic
numbers to twelve inclusive.</p>

<p>Teach the pupils that sixty minutes
make an hour.</p>

<p>Review by careful questioning that
which was done at previous exercises.</p>

<p>Develop all ideas as far as possible
by questioning the pupils.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>Tell the Pupils That:</b><br>
</p>

<p>The little spaces around the face
of the clock are named minutes.</p>

<p>The big hand is the minute hand
and it counts the minutes.</p>

<p>There are sixty little minutes
around the face of the clock which
the minute hand has to count.</p>

<p>The figures are named hours.</p>

<p>The little hand is the hour hand
and it points out the hours.</p>

<p>The minute hand reaches clear to
the minutes, and the hour hand
touches only the hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">
<b>Teach The Hour.</b><br>
</p>

<p>When the hour hand points to figure
1, it is one o’clock.</p>

<p>When the hour hand points to
figure 2, it is two o’clock.</p>

<p>When the hour hand points to
figure 3, it is three o’clock, etc.</p>

<p>Twelve is the home hour.</p>

<p>It is where the two hands live, yet
they are always going.</p>

<p>They never go backward.</p>

<p>They always start away from
home and go around back home
again.</p>

<p>They always get home together at
dinner time, that is, twelve o’clock,
and again in the middle of the night,
midnight, or twelve o’clock again.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>Exercise <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></b><br>
</p>

<p>Send a pupil to the blackboard
clock with a pointer; have him point
to one o’clock, two o’clock, etc.</p>

<p>Let others do the same, but do
not continue till the attention of the
class wavers.</p>

<p>Let pupils count the minutes, by
turns, each commencing where the
one preceding him left off, always
following the course of the hands of
a clock.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>Tell the Pupils That:</b><br>
</p>

<p>It is not our work to do the pointing
nor the counting. The hour and
minute hands on the face of a clock
always do that to tell us what time it
is.</p>

<p>The minute hand counts the minutes,
and the hour hand points to the
hours.</p>

<p>When the hour hand points to 1,
it is one o’clock.</p>

<p>When the hour hand points to 2,
it is two o’clock, etc.</p>

<p>Let us play it is dinner time.
The hour and minute hands are home
together, ready to start out and go
around again. They are always
ready to go and they always go the
right way. They never go the wrong
way. The minute hand goes all the
way around, counts all the minutes
and gets back home while the hour
hand goes to only one figure, and
then we know it is one o’clock, because
the hour hand is pointing to it.
The minute hand gets home just at
the same time that the hour hand
points to any hour.</p>

<p>There are twelve hours on the face
of the clock.</p>

<p>It takes the hour hand a long time,
twelve hours, to get home, but the
minute hand gets home as soon as it
counts the minutes all round the face
of the clock.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>Exercise <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></b><br>
</p>

<p>The teacher places the hands, each
time stopping the hour hand at the
right hour, and the minute hand at
the twelve o’clock, or home hour,
and having the pupils tell what time
it is, individually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">
<b>Exercise <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></b><br>
</p>

<p>Send a pupil to the board; let him
as the teacher dictates, make it one
o’clock, two o’clock, etc. Let others
do the same. Never continue for a
minute with flagging interest and
attention.</p>

<p>Drill until the pupils all see that
the minute hand goes all the way
around every time the hour hand goes
from one hour to another.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>Teach The Half Past.</b><br>
</p>

<p>Tell the pupils:—When the hour
hand gets past a number, half way to
the next number, the minute hand
has counted half the minutes and is
half way home.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>Exercise <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></b><br>
</p>

<p>Place the hands, at the half past
marks, and let pupils tell individually
what time it is.</p>

<p>Let pupils place the hands at the
half past marks as the teacher dictates.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>The Quarter Hour.</b><br>
</p>

<p>Develop the quarter past and quarter
of by the same devices used for
developing the half past.</p>

<p>Combine the hour, half hour and
quarter hour exercises.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>The Minutes.</b><br>
</p>

<p>The minutes past and minutes of
may be taught by various methods,
according to the ability of the pupils.</p>

<p>Many exercises may be devised by
the teacher besides these here given.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>Show The Pupils That:</b><br>
</p>

<p>The minute hand counts all the
minutes while the hour hand goes
from one hour to another.</p>

<p>The minute hand goes twelve
times as fast as the hour hand.</p>

<p>The minute hand counts twelve
minutes while the hour hand is going
past one minute.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>Exercise <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr></b><br>
</p>

<p>Play it is dinner time, and the two
hands are home together again, but
they cannot stop, for it is their duty
to always keep going.</p>

<p>Now we find the hour hand has
gone past just one minute. It
did not say anything about the minute
nor even point at it because it
never does do that. It just went
past twelve, the home hour, and then
past one minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>What did the minute hand do?</p>

<p>It counted twelve minutes.</p>

<p>Then what time does the big minute
hand tell us that it is?</p>

<p>It tells us that it is twelve minutes
after, or past twelve.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>Show The Pupils That:</b><br>
</p>

<p>The minute hand gets home twelve
times as often as the hour hand.</p>

<p>The minute hand starts from home
just when the hour hand starts from
an hour.</p>

<p>The number of minutes from home
to the minute hand is what the minute
hand has counted each time, and
it shows the time, or minutes past an
hour.</p>

<p>The number of minutes from the
minute hand around to home again is
what the minute hand will have to
count each time, and it shows the
time or minutes to an hour, or of an
hour.</p>


<p class="p2 center">
<b>Exercise <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr></b><br>
</p>

<p>Drill in placing hands for pupils to
tell the time.</p>

<p>Dictate for pupils to place hands.</p>

<h3>
MISCELLANEOUS DRILL.<br>
</h3>
</div>


<p>One of the main objects of time
drill in the schoolroom is to aid in effecting
order.</p>

<p>Decorum acquired from time drills
in the schoolroom characterize pupils
on the streets, in public meetings,
and in society everywhere.</p>

<p>The following time drills are very
beneficial: Exercises in timing pupils’
work and plays.</p>

<p>Training pupils to keep time to
martial music by beating stepping or
other movements.</p>

<p>One that little ones particularly
enjoy is to hipity-hop in time to martial
music.</p>

<p>Any exercises in stepping, beating
or counting time.</p>

<p>Beating the measures while practicing
the natural scale in music.</p>

<p>Practicing kindergarten plays in
time to music or singing.</p>

<p>Thorough training in school tactics.
All school tactics tend toward developing
the faculty, time. For this
reason the teacher cannot be too zealous
in training it.</p>

<p>Teaching the time table:</p>

<ul><li>60 seconds make a minute,</li>
<li>60 minutes make an hour,</li>
<li>24 hours make a day (and night),</li>
<li>7 days make a week,</li>

<p>Letting pupils guess the time, at
any hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Letting pupils close their eyes for
a short period, and afterward guessing
how long a time it was.</p>

<p>Letting pupils guess how long it
took them to write or recite a certain
lesson or to do a certain thing.</p>

<p>Recollection of time as:—</p>

<p>Having pupils recall the hour, day,
week, month or season any event

while teacher holds up pencil a certain
number of seconds.</p>

<p>Sun time:—</p>

<p>The sun rises in the east.</p>

<p>When the sun rises it is morning.</p>

<p>When the sun shines in at the east
windows it is forenoon.</p>

<p>When the sun shines strait in at
the south windows it is noon.</p>

<p>When the sun shines strait down
on you, so that your shadow is right
around your feet, it is noon.</p>

<p>When the sun shines in at the west
windows it is afternoon.</p>

<p>The sun sets in the west.</p>

<p>When the sun sets it is evening.</p>

<p>Teach the abbreviations, A. M.

birthday come? and like questions.</p>

<p>Ages of persons:—</p>

<p>Let pupils tell the dates of their
birthdays, their parents’ birthdays, or
